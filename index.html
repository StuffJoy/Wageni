                <li>Thou shalt have no form of co-dependency upon me. I am your girlfriend, not thy crutch.</li>
                <li>Thou shalt not refer to me as thoust "best friend". Thou must maketh thine own community.</li>
                <li>Thou shalt not share intimate details with any woman not previously known to be.</li>
                <li>Thou shalt be my lover, not my friend.</li>
                <li>Thou shalt have no whimsical, fun, nor comical bedsheets.</li>
                <li>Thou shalt send no images of thine phalanx. Portraits must be suggestive, not bare.</li>
                <li>Thou shalt not gaze upon my presence if thou canst maintain banter.</li>
                <li>Thou shalt learn how to kiss effectively; thou who cannot kiss, cannot... well.</li>
                <li>Thou shalt not start conversations with me after 10 pm, for that is bedtime.</li>
                <li>Thou shalt not have my phone password.</li>
                <li>Thou shalt not like someone before 21 days.</li>
